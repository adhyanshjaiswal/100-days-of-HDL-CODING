#100-days-of-HDL-CODING

My name is Adhyansh Jaiswal, and I am deeply passionate about exploring the intricacies of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration). I have embarked on an ambitious 100-day journey, focusing on mastering RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and verification. This journey primarily involves the use of Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) for coding. To bring my designs to life, I utilize EDA PLAYGROUND for RTL code simulation and the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite for synthesis tasks. Additionally, I have incorporated EDA Playground into my learning process. This comprehensive exploration allows me to expand my knowledge and skills in VLSI design, pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in this field.
